# Program Description
A Blackjack game that implements Java 2D Graphics and multiple classes.

This program simulates a Blackjack game and tries to imitate the Blackjack interface found on the mobile game "BitLife." This program has three classes. The card class holds two integer values: the card suit and the card rank. The deck class creates a deck composed of 52 card objects; each deck consists of 4 suits and 13 card ranks per suit. Finally, the main class draws the JComponents onto the screen which make up the frame's layout, and reads and writes information to a text file that keeps track of each registered user.

This program was coded for the ICS4U class. It demonstrates my knowledge with Java as well as objects, classes and files.
