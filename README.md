### Program Description
---
A Blackjack game that implements Java 2D Graphics, multiple classes, and files.

This program simulates a Blackjack game and tries to imitate the Blackjack interface found on the mobile game BitLife. This program has three classes. The card class holds two integer values: the card suit and the card rank. The deck class creates a deck composed of 52 card objects with each deck consisting of 4 suits and 13 card ranks per suit. Finally, the main class draws the JComponents onto the screen and reads and writes information to a text file that keeps track of each registered user.

This program was coded for the ICS4U class. It demonstrates my knowledge with Java as well as 2D graphics, classes and files.
